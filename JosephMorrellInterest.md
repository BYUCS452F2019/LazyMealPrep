I'm interested in this project, because of all the ideas shared so far it seems like the one I'd like to see really happen the most.  I think it could be very useful and convenient, and I'm really interested in the concept of working with a grocery store's online cart API especially, that's a smart idea.

I think, given enough time, it could be a good idea to establish compatability with multiple stores, not just Walmart.  I know Smith's has a similar online shopping cart system, and I'm sure other stores do the same.  Optional calorie and nutrient counting services for meals and ingredients could be a nice feature too.

We're meant to comment on Business, Legal, and Technical aspects in this response.  Business wise, well let's face it I don't think anything in this class is going to actually have any sort of business relevance at least until it's finished; legally I can't see anyone taking an issue in something like this.

Technically, I think it would be nice to have application and browser based front ends, and of course a relational or NoSQL database on the backend.  But that's what we're here to learn about.
